#Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
#A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
#To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:

def my_custom_print(text):
	text = f"-----{text}-----"

	print(text)


person = {
	"age": 27,
	"firstName": "Reza",
	"lastName": "Qadimi",
	"username": "Reza-Qadimi",
}
