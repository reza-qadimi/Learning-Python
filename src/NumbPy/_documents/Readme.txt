NumPy is a Python library.

NumPy is used for working with arrays.

NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".

Created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant - Open Source and Free to use

why to use:
--------------------------------------------------

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

This behavior is called "locality of reference" in computer science.

This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.
