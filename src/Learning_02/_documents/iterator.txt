An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.

An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.

Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().



Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.

All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator


itemsIterator = iterate(items)

print(next(itemsIterator))

for item in items:
	print(item)

Create an Iterator
	To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.

	As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.

	The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.


class MyNumbers:
	def __iter__(self):
	self.a = 1
	return self

def __next__(self):
	x = self.a
	self.a += 1
	return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)
print(next(myiter))


The example above would continue forever if you had enough next() statements, or if it was used in a for loop.

To prevent the iteration to go on forever, we can use the StopIteration statement.

In the __next__() method, we can add a terminating condition to raise an error if the iteration is done a specified number of times:

-> raise StopIteration
